# Turtle-Geometry-
The turtle geometry is a textbook written by Hal Abelson and Andrea diSessa. I found it useful in encouraging student to explore properties of the geometry displayed by the program. This repository includes basic application of turtle geometry based on python turtle. The functions are all based on the pseudocode in the text book. I hope the functions can help students who want to get hands on the turtle geometry and desgin their own small programs.
